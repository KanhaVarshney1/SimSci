### Aim

To verify **Theveninâ€™s Theorem** and **Maximum Power Transfer Theorem** using a resistive electrical circuit, and to experimentally demonstrate that:

1. Any linear electrical network with voltage and resistors can be replaced by an equivalent Thevenin voltage source and series resistance.
2. Maximum power is transferred to the load when the load resistance is equal to the Thevenin resistance of the network supplying the power.
